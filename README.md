### What I'm currently developing in

My third year dissertation used Python, Networkx, Pandas and Matplotlib to source, generate, analyse and compare the international trade network and the global alliance network.

For my fourth year I am working on multiple robotics projects and studying modules including computer vision, simulation and machine learning.
